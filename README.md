I have created my web portfolio on the basis of mock design by using html, css and bootstrap.
There were few challenges that I had to face during develpoment. For example responsivness of web design. To overcome this challenge, I have used bootstrap.
During the development, I have leanrt how  to use different elements and how to make components responsive according the different screen sizes.
Bootstrap is used for this web design through bootrap CDN.
